# Generating Shellcode
When exploits contain shellcode it by necessity will not phone home to you. This much is obvious. Use [[MSFVenom]] to generate shellcode with an implant or a simple shell depending on your specific task. Then replace the existing shellcode. The return address shouldn't be changed, but you want to be sure to avoid bad characters. For example, "\\x00" is usually a badchar. An exploit developer worth their salt will include badchars in their code as comments or similar.  

# Reconstruction
Sometimes, malware authors, especially in the case of scripts, will deliberately insert simple breaking changes so they can ensure that those who are using their code know what they are doing. Most of these can be quickly identified by a competent developer or pentester.

>You should understand the exploit code you are running enough to explain it to another operator. Further, this explanation should satisfy them. If you can do this, you can fix the exploits without issue.
