Metasploit is an exploitation framework that is essential to any penetration testing toolbox. It packages hundreds of exploits with plug-and-play functionality to give you a smooth experience, providing also the [[MSFVenom]] payload generation tool and the [[Meterpreter]] implant. 

A course on Metasploit usage can be found here: https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/
This course covers Metasploit usage in-depth, and is a great point to start from. 

> [!warning]
> Please take the time to understand your exploits. Metasploit is a very powerful tool, but it is also one that can isolate you from the process to an unhealthy degree. Always attempt to understand your environment and the exploits that you are running, so you do not accidentally damage your target in unintended ways. An easy way to do this is with the builtin `edit` command. 

Start the interactive framework with 
```shell
msfconsole # Start the Metasploit Framework interactive console
```

Use the following commands to navigate modules
```shell
msf6> help # Get a comprehensive listing of commands
msf6> search <search  term> # search for an exploit with key terms
msf6> use <name or number> # Select an exploit to interact with
msf6> back # Unselect the selected exploit
msf6> sessions # List running Meterpreter or command shell sessions
msf6> sessions -i <number> # Interact with a session
msf6> sessions -u <number> # Upgrade a session to a Meterpreter shell
```

Use the following commands to use exploits
```shell
msf6> set <property> <value> # Set options on an exploit module
msf6> setg <property> <value> # Set an option globally for all modules. ex: RHOSTS
msf6> options # List main options for exploit and selected payload
msf6> run # Execute the exploit
```
