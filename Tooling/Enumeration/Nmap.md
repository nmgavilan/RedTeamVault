Use for NSE scripting engine, and maybe network enumeration. ~~[[Rustscan]] is better for quickly enumerating open ports on a single device.~~

> [!danger] Detection Risk
> Use wisely if detection is a concern. Most competent AV/IDS/EDR can detect port scanning, and NAC will lock you out. A good counter is using the -T timing option to make sure that IPS does not have the resources to keep your scan packets in memory.

IDS/IPS evasion is covered in this list of flags. For example, use source port 53 to impersonate DNS and evade some poorly written firewall rules.

## Standard Scans

```shell
nmap -sn -n -vv -oN <scan outfile> <subnet> # Subnet scan

nmap -T4 -p- -vv -oN <scan outfile> --disable-arp-ping -Pn -n <target> # Full port scan (slow, even with T4)

nmap -sC -sV -p <port1,port2> -vv -oN <scan outfile> <target> # Default scripts scan

nmap -p <port> --script=<service>* -oN <scan outfile> <target> # All scripts scan
```

## Example Stealth Scan
```shell
nmap --disable-arp-ping -n -g 53 -Pn --max-rate=10 -p <port> -oN <scan outfile> <target> -vv # Disabled ARP ping, ICMP ping, DNS resolution; spoofed source port, rate limited.
```
